The top level folder is still named task2, as we submitted code here prior to the deadline. As the code for Task1 was still missing and we did not have write access to the code folder anymore we have opted to move the code for task1 here as well.

Now the code for task 2 lives in the Task2 directory and the code for task 1 lives in the Task1 directory.
Task1 is further divided into the code for the 3D-UNet model and the code for the SegResNet model we used for the final submission.
